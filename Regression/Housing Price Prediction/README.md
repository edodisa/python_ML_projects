# House Price Prediction

In this project we will provide data analysis on a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices?resource=download) about the housing price in California.
We will use machine learning to implement linear regression and random forest regression models in order to predict the price of an house.
We will use Grid Search in order to find the best combination of hyperparameters.
