# Heart Disease Prediction

In this project, using the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) we will use machine learning to make predictions on whether a person is suffering from Heart Disease or not.
Specifically we will implement KNN Classifier, SV Classifier, Tree and Random Forest Classifier to find the best model in our case.
