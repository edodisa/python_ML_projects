# Mushroom Classification

In this project, using the dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedzayton/mushroom-classification-rf/data), we will use Machine Learning to classify mushrooms.
Specifically we will Random Forest Classifier and a simple Neural Network to find the best model in our case.
