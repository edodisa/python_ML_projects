# Titanic Survival Prediction

In this project we will use Machine Learning to create a model that predicts which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck.
We will work with the datasets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).
We will build a pipeline in order to apply the preprocessing transformation to our data in a more simple way.
We will implement Random Forest Classifier.
